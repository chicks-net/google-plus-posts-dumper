## Motivation

* I wanted to do something in rust.
* I had a pile of HTML from my google+ dump that needs to be converted to hugo-friendly Markdown.

## Status

It processes command line arguments and verifies that the directories are
there and laid out as expected.  Then it finds the HTML files in that
directory.

## Disclaimer

This code was written by human hands using `vim` without performance
enhancing drugs or AI coding assistance.  If you're into those things,
you be you.  But at this point in my life I'd rather see how well I
can do naturally.  I feel confidant that I'm learning more this way.
