# google-plus-posts-dumper

## Motivation

* I wanted to do something in rust.
* I had a pile of HTML from my google+ dump that needs to be converted to hugo-friendly Markdown.

## Status

It processes command line arguments and verifies that the directories are
there and laid out as expected.  Then it finds the HTML files in that
directory.
