 Would you have preferred that the open hardware folks left the technology domain to look for their analogies?  Would you have felt better about comparing open hardware to the French Revolution?  Or the Renaissance?  I think Open Compute is like the Bronze Age.  You have this process of designing servers that was reserved for the Gods, but now it has been brought down into the hands of mere men.  Dell and IBM are already retreating in the face of the bronze dagger wielding insurgent ops guys.</div><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/infrastructure-as-a-service/open-hardware-is-like-linux-true-or-false/d/d-id/1113655" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>Open Hardware Is Like Linux: True Or False?
