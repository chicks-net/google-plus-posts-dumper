[... ...] Hipsters fetishize clothes above drugs, while for hippies it’s the opposite.&quot;  I was certain this was an Onion-worthy spoof for the first half of it.  But when I started looking into the rest of their site I find the headline/blurb on the home page states:<br><br><br>&quot;It is no secret that Google has some of the richest homosexuals in the world as investors and they have a major influence on how Google works. To provide proof of this is simple. Did you know that Google will block sex results that involve hetero people, but a confused child can type in the word “Twinkie” and instead of getting information on the favorite cream filled treat, they will be bombarded with a sea of gay-fully delightful imagery of [...]&quot;<br>So, yeah.  Hmmm.  This is an earnest perspective shared with other zealots spreading stereotypes in a fashion that Christ would frown upon and I can&#39;t stop laughing about.  With my hair I get the &quot;hippy&quot; pejorative often and somehow I continue to produce and consume with aplomb.  But realities like mine will never make it to most readers of this.  Making reality-based arguments will get us nowhere.<br><br>I want to write an article &quot;Why do Science Deniers Still Exist in America?&quot;  But we don&#39;t have a catchy term for science deniers.  Well, there&#39;s &quot;fundie&quot;.  But maybe I&#39;m too squeamish to make that my title.  Really, I don&#39;t have the heart or drive to write the article at all.  It won&#39;t do any more than this hilarious article to bring us to together or help us understand each other better.  Maybe after I stop laughing I&#39;ll understand them better.<br><br>All of this leads to two questions for me.<br><br>The blurb from the main page about the homosexual agenda at google -- I can&#39;t even type it without laughing -- makes me wonder: how did these people do a web site if they can&#39;t find hetero porn on google?  Really -- maybe I&#39;ve been geeking too long to realize how easy things are now.  But I have some faith left in my ability to evaluate the magnitude of technical challenges and hosting a web site is definitely harder than finding porn through google.  Even putting in your credit card to buy hosting is harder than finding porn.  And I dare you to search for &quot;twinkie&quot; on google.  You&#39;re an adult.  You can handle the results.  Google it.<br><br>And lastly, is pot available at every bus stop in America?  Wow.  That&#39;s amazing.  There&#39;s not shelter or safety or sanity at every bus stop in America, but there&#39;s marijuana?  How did this happen and I didn&#39;t hear about it in The Economist or US News?  Somebody has to be making some real money from that sort of operation.  It would have to be bigger than Walmart.  Why aren&#39;t they funding legalization efforts?  Shouldn&#39;t we be trumpeting the jobs being created?   Maybe we should outsource protecting the children to them since the police are busy busting pot heads.  But can we trust an organization that is such an obvious monopoly?  <br><br>And if you see me at a bus stop this morning, I&#39;m just there to protect the children.</div><a href="http://christwire.org/2010/10/why-do-hippies-still-exist-in-america/" target="_blank" class="link-embed"><h3>Why Do Hippies Still Exist in America?</h3><img src="http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/cw_logo.jpg" alt=""></a></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/109642502218172288796">Amy Zukowski</a></div></div><div class="comments"><div class="comment"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/109642502218172288796" class="author">Amy Zukowski</a><span class="time"> - 2011-09-07 09:42:15-0700</span><div class="comment-content">Did you note that the author is a &quot;Children&#39;s Party Entertainer&quot; - that is as scary to me as his &quot;psychotropic-induced&quot; rant...</div></div></div></body></html>
