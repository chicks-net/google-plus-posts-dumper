So updates are not propagating.  Plus you have to go to the developers site for updates, but the links everybody has in their gadgets broke too so you have to bring up the browser and site by hand.  So it seems Microsoft is still the land of half-assed half measures for half-wits.<br><br>One of the gadgets that seemed likely to be helpful was a world clock.  For my job US Eastern, US Pacific, and UTC are relevant almost every day.  The selection method was based on cities, so Eastern and Pacific went smoothly, but then how do you do UTC?  If I was the developer I would have created a fake city for the major time zones, but since source code is a Big Secret I can&#39;t even fix this for myself and submit a patch.  Of course, even if the source was available it would require VC++ which I&#39;m not going to pay for.<br><br>But there are some cities that live in UTC and have no DST.  It turns out that Accra, Ghana is such a city.  There are probably others, in Ghana at least, but Accra seems to not be replicated outside of Ghana, so you avoid ambiguity.  Thus Accra accurately accomplishes UTC accessibly.  :)  Can you remember that? :)  Do you know of any others?</div></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div></body></html>
