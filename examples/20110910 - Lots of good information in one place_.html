Ask for things or send things once a day. Refresh your notifications by muting and refreshing your screen.</b><br><b>2. Ask for goods once a day. Reset timers by not asking for two days. See #1.</b><br><b>3 (UPDATED). We can accept only one building OR one legend, and one workshop good per ally per day. See #1.</b><br><b>4. Mess halls are valuable. Sell them. See #1.</b><br><b>5. Certain bonuses can only be clicked once. Don&#39;t spam embassy bonuses or expedition bonuses.</b><br><b>6. Hate &quot;Too many goods&quot; pop-ups? Put away your workshop!</b><br><b><i>7 (UPDATE). Gift timers appear to be based on the time the gift is sent, not when it is received!</i></b><br><br><b>1. NOTIFICATIONS WINDOW:</b> The notifications window is (sort-of) fixed! Before they fixed the problem, you could not go back beyond one page of requests because the &quot;More&quot; button did not show any results. (it still doesn&#39;t! lol) Well, now you can mute any post that you have fulfilled, and once you have muted your entire page, you can refresh your tab and another page of requests pops up! This means that you don&#39;t have to spam notifications or requests, hoping that they stay on the first page long enough to get clicks! You can send out a request once and know that people will be able to get to it! Spamming requests only (a) frustrates you for not getting the things you want, and (b) causes more unnecessary clicking for your allies.<br><br><b>2. GOODS REQUESTS:</b> After a lot of testing and discussion, we have come up with a pretty good reasoning/solution to the workshop goods problem. We believe that there is an internal City of Wonder timer that is started when you receive an item from an ally that lasts 24 hours. Each ally has their own timer, and there is no way of synchronizing them because people click requests on their own time. Each ally can successfully gift you one workshop item in a rolling 24-hour period. Sending out more than one request per day is not beneficial and will actually hurt your workshop numbers (see #1). It is even recommended that if you are having problems getting items, you can reset everyone&#39;s timer by not requesting anything for two days. <br><br><b>3. GIFTS (UPDATED!):</b> Each ally is allowed to receive ONLY one building OR one legend, and in addition one workshop request in a rolling 24-hour period! The first gift that you send is the one that registers in the system. The second gift returns an error screen. (Thanks <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/116649922771622916227" oid="116649922771622916227" >Rob Barnes</a></span>!) Sending out multiple gifts results in the same errors we are all used to seeing: &quot;Oops! Unfortunately, you cannot accept gifts at this time!&quot; This also ties in with #1 above.<br><br><b>4. GIFTS CAN BE SOLD:</b> Each item in the game has a purchase price and a selling price that is a fraction of the purchase price. Some items are worth more than others. The Mess Halls that are currently in our options to gift SELL for 20,000 coins each! This means that those who need an economic boost can request Mess Halls and make hundreds of thousands of coins very quickly! Great for starter cities and established cities! Remember to build it before you sell it, each build grants you 200 XP! Also remember to follow rule #1 for this as well.<br><br><b>5. BONUS REPETITION:</b> Many people post every exploration bonus, thinking that more bonuses equals more coins for our allies. Certain bonuses cannot be collected more than once, and it seems that Playdom has tightened the grip on this quite a bit. Here is a short list of what can be collected repeatedly and what cannot:<br><br>Embassy Expansion Bonus: Can only be collected once (post only one)<br><i>(EDIT: There seems to be a bug and certain bonuses can be recollected while other times they can not. Further testing will be done to validate this behavior.)</i><br>Trade/Culture/War: Each can be collected once (post one of each)<br>Assisting with Goods: One click per person (post the one you need the most)<br>Assisting with Wonders: 30 per day regardless of who asks for it (post them all)<br><i>(Note: unless is a multi-part wonder, in which case you can help in every phase, even if you have already helped 30 people!)</i><br>Collecting Gifts: Unlimited, but repeat gifts will not be collected (post them all)<br>Achievement Bonuses: Unlimited (post them all)<br><br><b>6. NO MORE GOODS POP-UPS!:</b> (This one courtesy of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink bidi_isolate" href="https://plus.google.com/112027319219179716369" oid="112027319219179716369" >Chris Nichols</a></span> ! Thanks!) I know some of you have experienced this already. You go to collect your 5-minute goods, and get the annoying pop-up, &quot;Too many goods!&quot; Well, Chris found out a really slick way of getting rid of those popups! Simply put away your workshop prior to harvesting! You will not lose any goods previously earned, you will not gain any more, and you can put your workshop back down when you are done harvesting! Brilliant!<br><br><b>7. GOODS TIMER UPDATE!:</b> It has been discovered that gifts can be repeatedly collected from the same ally over and over as long as the time stamp for each gift is past a rolling 24 hours! This was discovered when collecting gifts sent to a temporarily inactive player. We were able to collect 30 Mess Halls from the same 5-6 people sending gifts! We believe the same rule applies to Workshop goods, but this has not been confirmed.</div></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/115945372843047058818">Nathan Weinberg</a></div><div class="resharers">Reshared by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YuenLoongNgui">Yuen Loong Ngui</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LouisDhority">Louis Dhority</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/115876594992501739515">nancie mendez</a></div></div></body></html>
